<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Christian Holladay and I am a <?php echo $data['about']->age?> year old programmer from Missouri.
I am interested in anything related to technology, including circuitry, robotics, programming, gaming, and AI/Automation.
Because of this, I have spent much of my free time teaching myself how to write code and make fun projects with my friends.
I love bringing creations to life and programming gives me the tools to do just that.
My dream is to have a career in programming so I can earn an income doing what I love.
</p>
<p>
I am proficient with C#, PHP, HTML, CSS and Python;
very knowledgable with Javascript, C++ and C;
and have previously used Lua to some extent.
</p>
<p>
I have made at least a dozen games in Unity, a score of applications in .NET, a handful of Python apps, and a few websites.
</p>
<p>
I am currently working on a web project of my own, as well as assisting another client with the code for an Unreal-Engine game.
