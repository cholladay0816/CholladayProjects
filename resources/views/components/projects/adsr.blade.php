    I was inspired to make this project after discovering a series of speedrun parody videos known as 'American Dad Speedruns.'
    It's a parody where people poke fun at normal speedruns - a challenge to complete a video game as quickly as possible -
    by 'speedrunning' a video of the American Dad TV show's opening theme, and shortening the clips with editing software to 'save time.' <br/>
    People were trying to place their scores on <a href="https://www.speedrun.com" class="text-black dark:text-white">speedrun.com</a> and getting banned/rejected/ignored etc,
    so I made this website as a fun place for people to post their scores and watch content from other people
    who also enjoyed the parody videos.

    The main goal of this project was to make a quick, informal website that looks very similar to speedruns.com while being
    secure and easy to use.
    The site will remain up as an archive until we decide to stop paying for hosting, or Adult Swim asks us to take it down.

    This site was a fun exercise in making quick, efficient webpages, and I completed this project in about 2 days.
    The site can allow users to sign up, submit and delete runs, and request or delete all userdata.
    I require all runs to be manually verified to avoid inappropriate/off-topic/unfair posts.
    These runs can be approved by an administrator user who has access to the administrator dashboard.
